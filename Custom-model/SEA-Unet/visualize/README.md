It is suitable for grayscale images such as ultrasound scans.

  - Diagonal â†˜
  - Diagonal â†™

## ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Open `visualize_sobel_output.py`
2. Set the `image_path` to the location of your test image
3. Run the script

```bash
python visualize_sobel_output.py
```

The script will show the four Sobel-filtered outputs side by side.
